# Image-Recognition-model
This project explores image classification using deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras, applying techniques across multiple datasets to demonstrate model development, optimization, and evaluation.  We begin with the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, implementing a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch.
